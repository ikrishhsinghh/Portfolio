    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>Hey there! I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, driven by a deep curiosity for technology, design, and data. While I’m still a student, I’m actively building a strong foundation in both creative and technical skills to shape a versatile and future-ready career.
I’m passionate about UI/UX Design and Graphic Design, I love crafting experiences that are not only visually appealing but also user-centric and meaningful. At the same time, I’m diving into the world of Cloud Engineering and Data Analytics, learning how to manage infrastructure and uncover insights that drive smart decisions.
I believe in staying curious, learning continuously, and combining creativity with logic to solve real-world problems. Whether it's designing an intuitive app interface, exploring cloud systems, or interpreting data patterns—I’m always excited to explore, build, and grow.
Currently learning. Constantly improving. Eager to contribute. <br>

      <h3>Computer Association | Team Social Media </h3>
      <h5>Pillai College of Arts, Commerce and Science | AUG 2025 - PRESENT </h5>
      <p>Being a part of Computer Association (CA) at PCACS as a First Year CS student has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my academic journey. Out of many applicants, only 22 were selected, and I am grateful to be among them. I have been assigned to the Social Media Department, where I contribute towards digital communication, branding, and engagement.<br>
CA, to me, is like a tree, built on one strong root of teamwork and vision, branching out into various departments like social media, technical, event management, and more. Each branch has its own responsibilities, but together we create something impactful.<br>
This role is teaching me not just technical and creative skills, but also coordination, leadership, and accountability. It’s more than an association, it’s a platform to grow, collaborate, and take responsibility while working towards a common goal.</p>

      <h3>Tiara Jewels (UI/UX Design)</h3>
      <p>This is my first UI/UX design project, created in Figma for a fictional jewelry brand named Tiara Jewels. The concept behind "Tiara" connects diamonds, jewels, and gold, symbolizing elegance and fusion.
The design focuses on a modern, user-friendly interface with smooth navigation, product highlights, and a premium shopping experience. It was a great learning step for me in UI/UX design fundamentals like layout, typography, visual hierarchy, and color balance.</p>
